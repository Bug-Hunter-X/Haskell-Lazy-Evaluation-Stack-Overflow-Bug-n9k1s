The following Haskell code attempts to perform lazy evaluation with an infinite list, but does not handle it correctly, resulting in a stack overflow.

```haskell
import Data.List (unfoldr)

-- Function to generate an infinite list of ones
ones :: [Integer]
ones = unfoldr (
_ -> Just (1, ())) 

-- Function that processes the infinite list
processList :: [Integer] -> Integer
processList xs = sum $ take 1000 xs

main :: IO ()
main = print $ processList ones
```

The problem lies in how `take` interacts with lazy evaluation.  `take 1000 ones` attempts to evaluate the first 1000 elements of `ones` before `sum` even starts, this forces the evaluation of an infinite list all at once, leading to stack overflow.

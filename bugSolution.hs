The solution involves using a more memory-efficient approach that processes the list element by element, preventing the creation of a large intermediate list.  The corrected code is:
```haskell
import Data.List (unfoldr)

ones :: [Integer]
ones = unfoldr (\_ -> Just (1, ())) 

processList :: [Integer] -> Integer
processList xs = sum $ take 1000 xs

main :: IO ()
main = print $ processList ones
```

The original `processList` function already correctly handles the lazy evaluation by using `take` before the `sum`. The bug was not in the use of `take`, but in not properly understanding lazy evaluation's characteristics with infinite data structures.  The provided solution is, therefore, already correct.  While `foldl` or a similar approach can be applied in various other scenarios for efficient lazy evaluation, `take` and `sum` are suitable and efficient here in combination with `ones`'s definition.  No changes are needed.
